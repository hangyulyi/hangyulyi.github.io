# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I hope to add on interesting features in the future.

This project was started off [Codehal's](https://youtu.be/Tkp3FDgOueM?si=gZ5A8lxLTJk4jY0y) tutorial and I continued to deviate towards something to showcase my skills better.

Some neat little features in the website consists of the following:

- [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)
- [form-to-google-sheets](https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets)
