# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I hope to add on interesting features in the future.

This project was started off [Codehal's](https://youtu.be/Tkp3FDgOueM?si=gZ5A8lxLTJk4jY0y) tutorial and I continued to deviate towards something to showcase my skills better.

Some neat little features in the website consists of the following:

- [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)
- [form-to-google-sheets](https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets)



# TODO:

- Change header "Portfolio" to a logo(create this)
- Find a font that looks nice (please will the font gods bless me with a prophecy)
- Figure out colour palette
- Edit typed.js format so it looks cool (maybe typing being done on a monitor pew pew)
- adjust margin and padding on some sections, looks interesting
- fix navbar for small screens (the indicator part)
- Does the indicator look good? maybe bold instead to indicate? idk
